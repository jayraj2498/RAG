Another\\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\\nsky during thunderstor ms. W e also experience a sensation of an electric\\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\\ndue to rubbing of insulating sur faces. Y ou might have also hear d that\\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter . Static means anything\\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with\\nthe study of forces, fields and potentials arising from\\nstatic charges .\\n1.2  E LECTRIC  CHARGE\\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\\naround 600 BC.

Many such pairs of materials wer e known which\\non rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of\\npapers.\\nIt was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth\\nare brought close to each other , they r epel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The\\ntwo strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were\\nrubbed, also r epel each other . However , the glass r od and wool attracted\\neach other . Similarly, two plastic r ods rubbed with cat’s fur r epelled each\\nother [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur . On the other hand, the plastic\\nrod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with\\nwhich the glass r od is rubbed. The glass r od repels the fur .\\nThese seemingly simple facts  were established from years of efforts\\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\\nan entry which is called the electric char ge. We say that the bodies like\\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\\nan electric charge on rubbing. T here are two kinds of electrification and\\nwe find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges  attract  each\\nother . The pr operty which dif ferentiates the two kinds of char ges is called\\nthe polarity  of charge.\\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\\nno longer attract each other . They also do not attract or r epel other light\\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named\\nas positive  and negative  by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\\nBy convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and\\nthat on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an\\nelectric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge\\nit is said to be electrically neutral.FIGURE  1.1 Rods: like char ges repel and unlike char ges attract each other .\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\\nthe amount of charge.\\nTry to understand why material bodies acquir e char ge. You know that\\nall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the\\nmaterials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges\\nare exactly balanced. For ces that hold the molecules together , forces that\\nhold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated\\nwith surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the\\nforces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and\\nit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is\\ntherefore essential that we learn more about such a force.\\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\\nfrom one body to the other .  A body can thus be char ged positively by\\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\\nby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\\nmaterial body.\\n1.3  C ONDUCTORS  AND INSULA TORS\\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others\\ndo not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are\\ncalled conductors . They have electric charges (electrons) that are\\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\\nbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,\\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators . Most  substances\\nfall into one of the two classes stated above *.\\nWhen some char ge is transferr ed to a conductor , it r eadily gets\\ndistributed over the entir e sur face of the conductor . In contrast, if some\\ncharge is put on an insulator , it stays at the same place. Y ou will lear n\\nwhy this happens in the next chapter .\\nThis property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\\n*There is a third category called semiconductors , which offer resistance to the\\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\\ninsulators.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The charges on metal leak through\\nour body to the ground as both are conductors of\\nelectricity. However , if a metal r od with a wooden or plastic\\nhandle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows\\nsigns of charging.\\n1.4  B ASIC PROPERTIES  OF ELECTRIC\\nCHARGE\\nWe have seen that ther e are two types of char ges, namely\\npositive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each\\nother . Here,  we shall now describe some other pr operties\\nof the electric charge.\\nIf the sizes of charged bodies are very small as\\ncompared to the distances between them, we treat them\\nas point charges . All the charge content of the body is\\nassumed to be concentrated at one point in space .\\n1.4.1  Additivity of charges\\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a\\ncharge; we shall follow it  up in the next section. W e shall\\ntentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If\\na system contains two point charges q1 and q2, the total\\ncharge of the system is obtained simply by adding\\nalgebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they\\nare scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1,\\nq2, q3, …, qn, then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn\\n.  Char ge has  magnitude but no dir ection, similar to mass. However ,\\nthere is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is\\nalways positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative.\\nProper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For\\nexample, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,\\n+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 i n\\nthe same unit.\\n1.4.2  Charge is conserved\\nWe have alr eady  hinted to the fact that when bodies ar e char ged by\\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\\ncharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric\\ncharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When\\nwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.\\nWithin an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to\\ninteractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is\\nfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved .\\nConservation of charge has been established experimentally.\\nIt is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated\\nsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyedFIGURE  1.2 Electroscopes: (a)\\nThe gold leaf electroscope, (b)\\nSchematics of a simple\\nelectroscope.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns\\ninto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus create d have\\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\\nthe creation.\\n1.4.3  Quantisation of charge\\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\\ngiven by\\nq = ne\\nwher e n is any integer , positive or negative. This basic unit of char ge is\\nthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge\\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\\nwritten as –e and that on a proton as +e.\\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e  is termed\\nas quanti sation of charge . There are a large number of situations in physics\\nwhere certain physical quantities are quanti sed. The quanti sation of charge\\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\\nMillikan in 1912.\\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\\ncoulomb  and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\\nsubsequent chapter . In ter ms of this definition, one coulomb is the char ge\\nflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1\\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\\nbasic unit of charge is\\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\\nThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom  encountered\\nand hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the\\nuniverse, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.\\nThus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount\\nof charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2\\nare integers, their dif ference is also an integer . Thus the char ge on any\\nbody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or\\ndecreased also in steps of e.\\nThe step size e is, however , very small because at the macr oscopic\\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of\\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,\\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\\nof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\\npractical consequence and can be ignor ed. However , at the micr oscopic\\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\\nof e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\\ninvolved that is very important.\\nExample 1.1  If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body\\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\\non the other body?\\nSolution  In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\\nunit for many practical purposes.\\nIt is, however , also important to know what is r oughly the number of\\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.\\nA cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024\\nelectrons.\\nExample 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\\ncup of water?\\nSolution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\\n(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023.\\nEach molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.3 4 × 107 C.\\n1.5  C OULOMB ’S LAW\\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges . Coulomb measured the\\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Thus, if two\\npoint charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,\\nthe magnitude of the force ( F) between them is given by\\n2 1\\n2q qF kr= (1.1)\\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?\\nCoulomb used a torsion balance *  for measuring the force\\nbetween two charged metallic spheres.

How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?\\nCoulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the\\ncharge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over\\nthe two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will\\nbe q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,\\netc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and\\nmeasured the force for different separations. He then varied the\\ncharges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .\\nComparing forces for different pairs of  charges at different\\ndistances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  was\\ninitially experimentally arrived at  in the manner described\\nabove. While the original experiments established it at a\\nmacroscopic scale, it has also been established down to\\nsubatomic level  ( r ~ 10–10 m).\\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit\\nmagnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:\\nCoulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition\\nfor a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far\\narbitrary. W e can choose any positive value of k. The choice\\nof k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the\\nvalue of k is about 9 × 109 2\\n2Nm\\nC. The unit of charge that\\nresults from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined\\nearlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we\\nsee that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\\nF = 9 × 109 N\\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance\\nof 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum\\nexperiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude\\n*A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later\\nby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,\\nto verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.\\n*Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\\ntwo charges ( q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.Charles Augustin de\\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\\nCoulomb, a French\\nphysicist, began his\\ncareer as a military\\nengineer in the W est\\nIndies.

If we\\nplace another point char ge q at a point P , wher e OP = r, then the char ge Q\\nwill exert a for ce on q as per Coulomb’s law. W e may ask the question: If\\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\\nnothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce act\\nwhen we place the char ge q at P. In or der to answer such questions, the\\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\\nWhen another char ge q is brought at some point P , the field ther e acts on\\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a\\npoint r is given as\\nE r r r ()= =1\\n41\\n402\\n02π πε εQ\\nrQ\\nrˆ ˆ(1.6)\\nwhere ˆ=r r/r, is a unit vector fr om the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\\nvector r. The wor d “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. W e obtain the\\nforce F exerted by a charge  Q on a charge q, as\\nF r =1\\n402πεQq\\nrˆ(1.7)\\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of char ge q by the vector r, it\\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C *.\\nSome important remarks may be made here:\\n(i)From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\\nelectric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be defined\\nas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\\n*An alter nate unit V/m will be intr oduced in the next chapter .FIGURE  1.8 Electric\\nfield (a) due to a\\ncharge Q, (b) due to a\\ncharge –Q.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\\ncalled a source charge  and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\\nsource charge, is called a test charge . Note that the source charge Q\\nmust r emain at its original location. However , if a char ge q is brought\\nat any point around  Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\\nEF=\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\uf8f7→lim\\nq q0(1.9)\\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to\\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\\ninside the sheet.\\n(ii)Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in\\nterms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\\nthe space coor dinate r. For dif ferent positions of the char ge q all over\\nthe space , we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\\n(iii)For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\\nnegative, the electric field vector , at each point, points radially inwar ds.\\n(iv)Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances fr om the char ge Q, the magnitude\\nof its electric field E is same.  The magnitude of electric field E due to\\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.\\n1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\\nConsider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,\\nr2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\\npositions of char ges q1, q2, ...,\\n qn.

After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however ,\\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannotFIGURE  1.9 Electric field at a point\\ndue to a system of charges is the\\nvector sum of the electric fields at\\nthe point due to individual charges.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

There will be some time delay between the effect\\n(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the\\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q1\\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\\ntransporting energy.

It is a vector quantity\\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\\nradially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In\\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\\nthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\\nand the r esulting figur e represents a field line. W e thus\\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\\nthe char ge and the lines ar e closer . Away fr om the char ge,\\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\\nresulting in well-separated lines.\\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.FIGURE  1.12 Field of a point charge. EXAMPLE  1.8\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

So if one wishes\\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry infor mation\\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\\nwher e it is weak. Figur e 1.13 shows a set of field lines. W e\\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.\\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\\ntransverse line element Dl  be placed at a distance r  from a point O. Then\\nthe angle subtended by Dl  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.\\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small\\nperpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written as\\nDW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances\\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\\nDW is 2\\n1rDW at P1 and an element of area 2\\n2rDW at P2, respectively. The\\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(2\\n1rDW) at\\nP1 and n/(2\\n2rDW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the\\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/ r2 dependence.\\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of for ce. This ter m is\\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\\nappr opriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we have\\nadopted in this book.\\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,FIGURE  1.13  Dependence of\\nelectric field strength on the\\ndistance and its relation to the\\nnumber of field lines.\\n*Solid angle is a measure of a cone.

When q = 90°, field\\nlines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it\\nat all (Fig. 1.15).\\nThe orientation of area element and not\\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\\norientation. This shows that an area element\\nshould be tr eated as a vector . It has a\\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\\nHow to associate a vector to the ar ea of a curved sur face? W e imagine\\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\\nwith it, as explained before.\\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\\nto be in the direction of the outward  normal. This is the convention used\\nin Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed\\nsurface equals DS ˆn where D S is the magnitude of the area element and\\nˆn is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through\\nan area element DS is defined by\\nDf = E.DS = E DS  cos q (1.11)\\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\\nthe area element. The angle q here is the angle between E and DS. For a\\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between\\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\\nthe expression E DS cos q  in two ways:  E ( DS cos q ) i.e., E times theFIGURE  1.15  Dependence of flux on the\\ninclination q between E and ˆn.\\nFIGURE  1.16\\nConvention for\\ndefining normal\\nˆn and DS. *It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. The\\nnumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to\\ndraw.

The line connecting the two charges defines\\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from – q to q is said to\\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of – q and q is\\ncalled the centre of the dipole.\\nThe total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However , at distances much lar ger than\\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2 a), the fields\\ndue to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/ r2 (the dependence\\non r of the field due to a single charge q).

(By permanent dipole, we\\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\\nThere is a force qE on q and a force – qE on – q. The net force on\\nthe dipole is zer o, since E is unifor m. However , the char ges ar e\\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\\nMagnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq\\n       = 2 q a E  sinq\\nIts dir ection is nor mal to the plane of the paper , coming out of it.\\nThe magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction\\nis nor mal to the paper , coming out of it. Thus,\\nt tt tt  = p × E (1.22)\\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\\nFigure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\\nwith respect to E.\\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\\npaper . The comb, as we know, acquir es char ge thr ough\\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\\nthe attractive force?

In this situation, it is easily seen\\nthat the paper should move in the direction of the comb!\\n1.12  C ONTINUOUS  CHARGE  DISTRIBUTION\\nWe have so far dealt with char ge configurations involving discr ete char ges\\nq1, q2, ..., qn. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\\nmany purposes, however , it is impractical to work in ter ms of discr ete\\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\\nexample, on the sur face of a char ged conductor , it is impractical to specify\\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)\\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\\nspecify the char ge DQ on that element. W e then define a surface char ge\\ndensity  s at the area element by\\nQ\\nSσΔ=Δ(1.23)\\nWe can do this at dif ferent points on the conductor and thus arrive at\\na continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface\\ncharge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level *. s  represents\\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,\\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\\nunits for s are C/m2.\\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density  l of a wire is defined by\\nQ\\nlλΔ=Δ(1.24)\\nwhere Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\\nhowever , includes a lar ge number of micr oscopic char ged constituents,\\nand DQ is the charge contained in that line element.

The units for r are C/m3.\\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer toFIGURE  1.21\\nDefinition of linear ,\\nsurface and volume\\ncharge densities.\\nIn each case, the\\nelement ( Dl, DS, DV)\\nchosen is small on\\nthe macroscopic\\nscale but contains\\na very large number\\nof microscopic\\nconstituents.\\n*At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

W e can see that explicitly in\\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23.\\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E . The total\\nflux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent\\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\\ncylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux,  f3 = 0. Further , the outwar d\\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\\nTherefore,\\nf1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2\\nS1 = S2 = S\\nwhere  S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\\nus note some important points regarding this law:\\n(i)Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\\nor size.\\n(ii)The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq.

(1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\\noutside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,\\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\\nFIGURE  1.23  Calculation of the\\nflux of uniform electric field\\nthrough the sur face of a cylinder .\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

For some symmetric charge\\nconfigurations, however , it is possible to\\nobtain the electric field in a simple way using\\nthe Gauss’s law.

The points P , P¢, P¢¢ so\\nobtained are completely equivalent with\\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\\nevery point must be radial (outward if l > 0,\\ninward if l < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.2 6.\\nConsider a pair of line elements P1 and P2\\nof the wire, as shown. The electric fields\\nproduced by the two elements of the pair when\\nsummed give a resultant electric field which\\nis radial (the components normal to the radial\\nvector cancel). This is true for any such pair\\nand hence the total field at any point P is\\nradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,\\nelectric field does not depend on the position\\nof P along the length of the wire. In short, the\\nelectric field is everywhere radial in the plane\\ncutting the wire normally, and its magnitude\\ndepends only on the radial distance r.\\nTo calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical\\nGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.2 6(b).\\nSince the field is everywhere radial, flux\\nthrough the two ends of the cylindrical\\nGaussian surface is zero.

The\\nfield at any point P , outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial\\ndistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,\\nalong the radius vector).\\n(i)Field outside the shell:  Consider a point P outside the\\nshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the\\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\\nO, passing thr ough P . All points on this spher e are equivalent\\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\\nDS at every point are parallel and the flux through each\\nelement is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the\\nGaussian surface is E × 4 p r2. The charge enclosed is\\ns × 4 p R2.

We say that the bodies like\\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\\nan electric charge on rubbing. T here are two kinds of electrification and\\nwe find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges  attract  each\\nother . The pr operty which dif ferentiates the two kinds of char ges is called\\nthe polarity  of charge.\\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\\nno longer attract each other . They also do not attract or r epel other light\\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\\nbodies are brought in contact.
